**Open Source Acoustic Neuromodulation for Tinnitus Relief**

NeuroAudio is a free, browser-based tool designed to help manage tinnitus frequencies through clinically-inspired Acoustic Coordinated Reset (CR) Neuromodulation and Notched Noise therapy.

## 🌍 Our Mission
Tinnitus affects millions, but professional treatments are often expensive or inaccessible. This project aims to democratize access to sound therapy. **No ads. No paywalls. Just relief.**

## ✨ Features
* **Pitch Matching:** Find your specific tinnitus frequency (200Hz - 12kHz).
* **Two Modes:**
    * *Tonal CR:* Randomized tones to desynchronize hyperactive neurons.
    * *Notched Noise:* Soothing white noise with your frequency surgically removed.
* **Session Tracking:** Automatically logs your daily therapy duration.
* **Visualizer:** Real-time feedback to confirm the audio is active.
* **Offline Capable:** Install it on your phone and use it without internet.
